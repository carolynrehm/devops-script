## For Continuous Integration Using Jenkins with Maven

1. Create an instance of an EC2 (Amazon Linux 2 AMI). For more on that, see [ec2-setup](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/blob/master/ec2-setup).

2. Connect to you EC2 using ssh.

   > ssh -i [pem file] ec2-user@[public ip]

3. Install git

   > sudo yum install git -y

4. Clone this repository onto your EC2

   > git clone https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script.git

5. Navigate into the project folder and execute install script. Select Java 8 when prompted.

   > cd devops-script
   > sh install.sh

6. Jenkins is ready for you to get started! Use the `cat` command to print the contents of the initialAdminPassword, install the suggested plugins, and set up an admin user.

   See [jenkinsfile-examples](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/tree/master/jenkinsfile-examples) for relevant pipeline scripts for your desired jobs. Also, make sure as you configure your jobs, limit the number of old builds to 1 or 2 so your EC2 doesn't have memory issues.

7. Make sure to add your webhook to your GitHub repository. This is done by navigating to the "Settings" tab and adding a webhook with a payload url of http://[your ec2 ip]:8080/github-webhook/ - for this to be functional, you must trigger the build once manually from the Jenkins console.

## For Continuous Deployment Using Jenkins with Maven + Containerization with Docker

1. Create an instance of an EC2 (Amazon Linux 2 AMI). For more on that, see [ec2-setup](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/blob/master/ec2-setup).

2. Connect to you EC2 using ssh.

   > ssh -i [pem file] ec2-user@[public ip]

3. Install git

   > sudo yum install git -y

4. Clone this repository onto your EC2

   > git clone https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script.git

5. Navigate into the project folder and execute install script. Select Java 8 when prompted.

   > cd devops-script
   > sh installv2.sh

6. Jenkins is ready for you to get started! Use the `cat` command to print the contents of the initialAdminPassword, install the suggested plugins, and set up an admin user.

   See [jenkinsfile-examples](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/tree/master/jenkinsfile-examples) for relevant pipeline scripts for your desired jobs. Also, make sure as you configure your jobs, limit the number of old builds to 1 or 2 so your EC2 doesn't have memory issues.

## For Continuous Deployment Using Jenkins with Node

1. Create an instance of an EC2 (Amazon Linux 2 AMI). For more on that, see [ec2-setup](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/blob/master/ec2-setup).

2. Connect to you EC2 using ssh.

   > ssh -i [pem file] ec2-user@[public ip]

3. Install git

   > sudo yum install git -y

4. Clone this repository onto your EC2

   > git clone https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script.git

5. Navigate into the project folder and execute install script. Select Java 8 when prompted.
   > cd devops-script

> sh node-install.sh

6. Jenkins is ready for you to get started! Use the `cat` command to print the contents of the initialAdminPassword, install the suggested plugins, and set up an admin user.

   See [jenkinsfile-examples](https://github.com/carolynrehm/devops-script/tree/master/jenkinsfile-examples) for relevant pipeline scripts for your desired jobs. Also, make sure as you configure your jobs, limit the number of old builds to 1 or 2 so your EC2 doesn't have memory issues.

7. You will need to configure jenkins with your gitlab credentials if you're working with a private repo. To do this, navigate to Jenkins homepage and then to "Credentials" on the left side of the landing page. Select your global domain under your stores, and then select "Add Credentials." From here, include your gitlab username and password. Once you click okay, an ID will be generated by Jenkins representing these credentials. This is your "credentialsId" in your Jenkinsfile.

8. Make sure to add your webhook to your GitHub repository. This is done by navigating to the "Settings" tab and adding a webhook with a payload url of http://[your ec2 ip]:8080/github-webhook/ - for this to be functional, you must trigger the build once manually from the Jenkins console.
